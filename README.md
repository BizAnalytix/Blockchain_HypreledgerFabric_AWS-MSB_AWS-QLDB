# Blockchain Hyperledger-Fabric AWS-QLDB AWS-MSB
 
This repo primarily intends to offer  
- A Sneak peek 
- canvassing of 3 major framework/services for Blcokchain
	- **Hyperledger-Fabric** 
	- **AWS-QLDB (AWS Quantum Ledger Database)**
	- **AWS-MSB (AWS Managed Blockchain)**
- Real world application of one of above Blockhain service 
	- Digital Asset Management



* For the ease of addressing, hereon, I'll use following pairs of terms interchangably - 
 - Hyperledger-Fabric as **HLF**
 - Hyperledger as **HL**
 - AWS-QLDB as **QLDB**
 - AWS MSB as **MSB**
 
***
This repo primarily intends to offer distillation of my experience in 3 major Blcokchain frameworks - HLF, QLDB & MSB. 
Please note: 
 - There are very many other popular Blockchain frameworks and tools available in the market in addition to the chosen ones in this repo, such as 
		- 
 
 - Many of these aforemention Blcokchain framework/services are very popular, and are being extensively used.
 - This repo doesn't intend to draw any sort of comparative view between the chosen framework/services and other popular frameworks.
 - This is truly illustrative in nature.

Blcokchain Frameworks do vary based on distinct needs, i.e., please choose your the right framework from very many Blockchain framework options based on whether you need 
 - a Centralized ledger database,
 - or a Multi-party, 
 - or a Fully managed blockchain network that helps eliminate intermediaries.
 
The commonality amongst All of the above frameworks: 
- each offers an *immutable and cryptographically verifiable record of transactions* 
- each one is also available in *DOCKER (containers)*
- One can use *CaaS (Kubernetes)* to seamlessly manage and govern these Blockchain containerized workload with the High availability, Auto Scalability, Self healing NFRs.  

# [1] Hyperledger Fabric HLF

HLF is one of the Framework from "HL Framework & Tools ecosystem" with the primary objective to provide **Permissioned with Channel Support**.
